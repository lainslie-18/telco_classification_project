## About the project

### Project Goals

- To identify drivers of customer churn and find a solution for increasing customer retention
- To construct a model that accurately predicts which customers are most likely to churn to focus retention efforts

### Project Description

why you are tackling this project, why it is important and how it could be of use to someone else beyond just the interest or new knowledge.

### Initial Hypotheses/Questions

- Do customers with month-to-month contracts churn at a higher rate? What are the churn rates with other contract types?

- Is there a certain tenure length where month-to-month customers are more likely to churn? What about customers with contracts?

- Is any specific service associated with higher churn rates?

- Is it higher monthly charges that are causing churn? If so, what is that threshold where most customers churn for their specific service?
